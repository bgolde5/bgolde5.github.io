# 5 Slices of Wisdom for Student Developers

As I'm writing this post, I'm entering my last semester as a senior majoring in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago. I feel it's important for me to guide you because I've had the privilege to make A LOT of mistakes over the last 4 years as a college student/aspiring developer. My wish for you is that you take something from this post that helps you in your path to success.

Take note, this post is not only for students! You may very well find some useful information here. Also, please be sure to comment below with your advice, feedback, questions, etc.

Now enough chatter, let's begin...

## 1. Learn C (At least the basics)

If you're saying to yourself, "Learning C is a waste of my time", then I suggest you read on.

You can think of C as the Latin on the programming world. If you learn Latin, it's really easy to learn new Western based languages as they all have common similarities to Latin.

Much like French and English have roots in Latin, many modern programming languages today have roots in C. For example, do you or have you ever used an iPhone or Mac? Have you played video games? Minecraft maybe? I'm guessing you most likely answered yes to one of those questions. If so, the languages used to develop iPhone apps, many video games, etc., can be traced back to the C programming language.

Another reason to use C is that many modern languages abstract very crucial concepts that are very important for programmers to be aware of.

Another reason to learn C is that top companies such as Google and Microsoft want and require you to know how to manage memory. You just can't get around it without learning C.

For starters, I recommend you start with **[Learn C The Hard Way](http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/)**. The "Hard Way" series is a great resource for learning any language. It's both free and much more enjoyable to read than 99% of the textbooks you'll find out there.

## 2. Learn to Manage Your Finances, NOW

If that voice in the back of your head is saying, "I don't have enough money to manage, there's no point, next post", think again. Even if you have a penny to your name, you should think very carefully how you spend that penny.

As a student, that very voice I just mentioned was my excuse for not managing my finances for the last 3 1/2 years in college. I told myself, "I'll wait until I'm finished with college and I begin making the real dough before I think about money management." I'll admit, that was a serious mistake on my part. I don't know how much money I could have saved or spent in meaningful places because I didn't carefully watch where I spent it.

I've come to a stark realization that sounds obvious to me now but it wasn't obvious a few years ago. My realization is this, "If I don't know how or I don't try to manage what little financial income I have now, what will make managing my (hopefully) larger career income any easier?" In fact, it will probably be much harder to manage the income I make from my career! This is the typical grass is greener B.S. mentality. The grass is not greener, start now!

I read a great book that is specifically addressed towards the younger audience. I highly recommend it, even if you are a dirt poor student living off of Top Ramen.

## 3. Find a Higher Purpose in Life

Oh no, here comes the Jesus talk.

I'm going to spare you any religious dogma as I grew up with enough of it around me. If you already have some higher focus in a religion, non-profit organization, cult (cough cough Scientology), etc., good for you. I still want you to answer this question, what is your purpose in life?

If you don't have an answer to that absolutely fundamental question, life may just flash before your eyes and before you know, you'll be on your death bed.

My suggestion for you is this, discover a purpose that allows you to give your gift fully. What is a gift you might ask? Many people are gifted in different ways. For example, Bach's gift was music, Gandhi's gift was leading the Indian people to freedom, and Thomas Jefferson's gifts were learning and writing (among many other things).

"But Bradley, you're telling me to just give my gift, I don't even know what my gift is or what a 'gift' is." Well ladies and gents, you must start somewhere.

I recommend the book/audioCD below. It doesn't directly talk about purpose but you will find yourself more connected to the world and I believe that is not only the first place to start but the best.
