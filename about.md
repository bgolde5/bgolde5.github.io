Hi and welcome to my webpage.

As a background, I'm currently studying Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago. I'll be earning my degree in the spring of 2016.

I'm also working as an intern at CCC Information Services part time in the Architecture / R&D department. My role at CCCIS is to help iOS team the development and testing of our newest mobile applications / SDK.
