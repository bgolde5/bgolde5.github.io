Hi an thanks for checking out my blog. I'm both a computer science student at the University of Illinois at Chicago and an Architecture/R&D intern at CCC Information Services. My role at CCCIS includes researching new technologies, working on internal projects, and assisting the iOS team with unit/UI testing.

I love iOS development. My latest project is ChiSalary, an app that let's you easily view the salaries of Chicago Employees. Click [here](http://bradleygolden.me/2016/01/14/chicago-salaries-ios-application/) to see more.
