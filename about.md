I'm a mobile developer intern at CCC Information Services.

I love Apple Products and developing for iOS. My latest iOS project is ChiSalary, an app that let's you easily view the salaries of Chicago Employees. Click [here](http://bradleygolden.me/2016/01/14/chicago-salaries-ios-application/) to see more.
