Hi and welcome to my blog.

I'm a soon to be computer science grad working at CCC Information Services with the Architecture / R&D department. My role at CCCIS is to help iOS team with various things.

My current interests are in mobile development, and my latest iOS project is ChiSalary, an app that let's you easily view the salaries of Chicago Employees. Click [here](http://bradleygolden.me/2016/01/14/chicago-salaries-ios-application/) to see more.
